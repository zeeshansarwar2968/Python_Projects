# Logical Programs

1. Gambler

> a. Desc -> Simulates a gambler who start with $stake and place fair $1 bets until
> he/she goes broke (i.e. has no money) or reach $goal. Keeps track of the number of
> times he/she wins and the number of bets he/she makes. Run the experiment N
> times, averages the results, and prints them out.
> b. I/P -> $Stake, $Goal and Number of times
> c. Logic -> Play till the gambler is broke or has won
> d. O/P -> Print Number of Wins and Percentage of Win and Loss.

2. Coupon Numbers

> a. Desc -> Given N distinct Coupon Numbers, how many random numbers do you
> need to generate distinct coupon number? This program simulates this random
> process.
> b. I/P -> N Distinct Coupon Number
> c. Logic -> repeatedly choose a random number and check whether it's a new one.
> d. O/P -> total random number needed to have all distinct numbers.
> e. Functions => Write Class Static Functions to generate random number and to
> process distinct coupons.

3. Simulate Stopwatch Program

> a. Desc -> Write a Stopwatch Program for measuring the time that elapses between
> the start and end clicks
> b. I/P -> Start the Stopwatch and End the Stopwatch
> c. Logic -> Measure the elapsed time between start and end
> d. O/P -> Print the elapsed time.

4. Cross Game or Tic-Tac-Toe Game

> a. Desc -> Write a Program to play a Cross Game or Tic-Tac-Toe Game. Player 1 is
> the Computer and the Player 2 is the user. Player 1 take Random Cell that is the
> Column and Row.
> b. I/P -> Take User Input for the Cell i.e. Col and Row to Mark the ‘X’
> c. Logic -> The User or the Computer can only take the unoccupied cell. The Game
> is played till either wins or till draw...
> d. O/P -> Print the Col and the Cell after every step.
> e. Hint -> The Hints is provided in the Logic. Use Functions for the Logic…
