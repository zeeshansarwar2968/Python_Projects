> 4. You toss a fair coin three times write a program to find following:
> a. What is the probability of three heads, HHH?
> b. What is the probability that you observe exactly one heads?
> c. Given that you have observed at least one heads, what is the probability that you observe at least two heads?

> 5. In my town, it's rainy one third of the days. Given that it is rainy, there will be heavy traffic with probability 12, and given that it is not > rainy, there will be heavy traffic with probability
> 
> 14. If it's rainy and there is heavy traffic, I arrive late for work with probability 12. On the other
> hand, the probability of being late is reduced to 18 if it is not rainy and there is no heavy traffic.
> In other situations (rainy and no traffic, not rainy and traffic) the probability of being late is 0.25.
> You pick a random day.
> Write a program to find following : 
> a. What is the probability that it's not raining and there is heavy traffic and I am not late?
> b. What is the probability that I am late?
> c. Given that I arrived late at work, what is the probability that it rained thatday?

> 6. Given the following statistics, write a program to find the probability that a woman has cancer if she has a positive mammogram result?
> a. One percent of women over 50 have breast cancer.
> b. Ninety percent of women who have breast cancer test positive on mammograms.
> c. Eight percent of women will have false positives.
> 
> 7. A bank teller serves customers standing in the queue one by one. Suppose that the
> service time XiXi for customer ii has mean EXi=2 (minutes) and Var(Xi)=1. We assume that
> service times for different bank customers are independent. Let YY be the total time the bank
> teller spends serving 50 customers. Write a program to find P(90<Y<110)
> 
> 8. In a communication system each data packet consists of 1000 bits. Due to the noise,
> each bit may be received in error with probability 0.1. It is assumed bit errors occur
> independently. Find the probability that there are more than 120 errors in a certain data packet.
> 
> 9. In a particular pain clinic, 10% of patients are prescribed narcotic pain killers. Overall,
> five percent of the clinic’s patients are addicted to narcotics (including pain killers and illegal
> substances). Out of all the people prescribed pain pills, 8% are addicts. If a patient is an addict,
> write a program to find the probability that they will be prescribed pain pills?
> 
> 10. X is a normally normally distributed variable with mean μ = 30 and standard deviation σ = 4. Write a program to find
> a. P(x < 40)
> b. P(x > 21)
> c. P(30 < x < 35)
> 
> 11. A radar unit is used to measure speeds of cars on a motorway. The speeds are
> normally distributed with a mean of 90 km/hr and a standard deviation of 10 km/hr. Write a
> program to find the probability that a car picked at random is travelling at more than 100 km/hr?
> 
> 12. Write a program to find the probability of getting a random number from the interval [2, 7]
> 
> 13. The table below shows the height, x, in inches and the pulse rate, y, per minute,
> for 9 people. Write a program to find the correlation coefficient and interpret your result.
> x ⇒ 68 72 65 70 62 75 78 64 68
