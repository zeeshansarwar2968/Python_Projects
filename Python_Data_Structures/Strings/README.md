# Questions on Strings

1. Write a Python program to calculate the length of a string.
2. Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.
    Sample String : google.com
    Expected Result : {'o': 3, 'g': 2, '.': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 1, 'm': 1, 'c': 1}

    Sample String : 'restart'
    Expected Result : 'resta$t'
4. Write a Python program to add 'ing' at the end of a given string (length should be at least 3). If the given string already ends with 'ing' then add 'ly' instead. If the string length of the
    given string is less than 3, leave it unchanged.
