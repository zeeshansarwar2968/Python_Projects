> # Basic Python
> 1. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
> 
> 2. Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from user
> and generate a list and a tuple with those numbers.
> Sample data : 3, 5, 7, 23
> Output :
> List : ['3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23']
> Tuple : ('3', ' 5', ' 7', ' 23')
> 
> 3. Write a Python program to display the first and last colors from the following list.
> color_list = ["Red","Green","White" ,"Black"]
> 
> 4. Write a Python program to print the documents (syntax, description etc.) of Python built-in
> function(s).
> Sample function : abs()
> Expected Result : mat
> abs(number) -> number
> Return the absolute value of the argument.
> 
> 5. Write a Python program to print the calendar of a given month and year.
> Note : Use 'calendar' module.
> 
> 6. Write a Python program to calculate number of days between two dates.
> Sample dates : (2014, 7, 2), (2014, 7, 11)
> Expected output : 9 days
> 
> 7. Write a Python program to check whether a specified value is contained in a group of values.
> Test Data :

> 
> 8. Write a Python program to create a histogram from a given list of integers.
> 
> 9. Write a Python program to concatenate all elements in a list into a string and return it.
> 
> 10. Write a Python program to print out a set containing all the colors from color_list_1 which are
> not present in color_list_2.
> Test Data :
> color_list_1 = set(["White", "Black", "Red"])
> color_list_2 = set(["Red", "Green"])
> Expected Output :
> {'Black', 'White'}
> 
> 11. Write a Python program to check whether a file exists.

> 14. Write a Python program to list all files in a directory in Python.
> 
> 15. Write a python program to access environment variables.
> 
> 16. Write a Python program to get the current username

> 19. Write a Python program to get file creation and modification date/times.
> 
> 20. Write a Python program to sort three integers without using conditional statements and loops.
> 
> 21. Write a Python program to sort files by date.
> 
> 22. Write a Python program to get the command-line arguments (name of the script, the number
> of arguments, arguments) passed to a script.
> 
> 23. Write a Python program to find the available built-in modules.
> 
> 24. Write a Python program to get the size of an object in bytes.
> 
> 25. Write a Python program to get the current value of the recursion limit.
> 
> 26. Write a Python program to count the number occurrence of a specific character in a string.
> 
> 27. Write a Python program to get the system time.
> 
> 28. Write a Python program to clear the screen or terminal
> 
> 29. Write a Python program to get the name of the host on which the routine is running.
> 
> 30. Write a Python program to access and print a URL's content to the console.
> 
> 31. Write a Python program to get system command output.
> 
> 32. Write a Python program to get the effective group id, effective user id, real group id, a list of
> supplemental group ids associated with the current process.
> Note: Availability: Unix.
> 
> 33. Write a Python program to get the users environment.
